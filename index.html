    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      I would inform the client about security practices that have been proven
      to be efficient.
    </p>
    <ol>
      This are:
      <li>
        <p>Sanitization of data</p>
        Make sure the data your system accepts is in the correct format. This
        can be achieved in for example NodeJS. Which offers a "sanitize-html
        package". The sanitize() method is then used to remove any unwanted
        elements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Authorization protocol</p>
        Use a well-known and trusted authorization protocol like OneLogin which
        is hard to crack.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bounty system</p>
        A bounty system for your security protocols is also a good solution.
        This involves hiring white hat hackers to test your system’s security
        and find vulnerabilities in your system.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>CI/CD</p>
        CI/CD which stands for Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration.
        This process checks every change against security checks. if the changes
        does not pass the checks gets flagged and prevents the code from going
        to production.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Network engineer</p>
        Hire a good network engineer. They are tasked with protecting the
        exchange of packets across the network.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Timeout session</p>
        Implement a timeout session so employees don’t have their credentials or
        other sensitive data visible in the browser for an extended period of
        time.
      </li>
    </ol>
